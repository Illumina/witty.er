## Bug fixes
- [#19](https://github.com/Illumina/witty.er/issues/19) Gzip is not supported well, so unzip to tmp dir before reading the unzipped file to avoid this problem. This also fixes issue as we no longer depend on BlockCompression.dll 
- [WIT-163](https://jira.illumina.com/browse/WIT-163) Support gzipped Bedfiles too.
