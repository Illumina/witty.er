[Release Notes Index](README.md)

## Feature updates
-  Support VNTR evaluation
-  Support Multi-allelic for DUP/DEL/CNV/INS as well.
-  Support VNTR cross-type evaluation against INS and DEL
-  Make SimpleCounting the default mode and rename Default to GenotypeMatching
-  Rename basepairDistance and percentDistance to absoluteThreshold and percentThreshold so we can use for all types, including VNTRs

- Update default bin sizes for each type to be appropriate based on dragen testing.

## Bug fixes
-  Gzip is not supported well, so unzip to tmp dir before reading the unzipped file to avoid this problem. This also fixes issue as we no longer depend on BlockCompression.dll 
-  Support gzipped Bedfiles too.
