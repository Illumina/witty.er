# Witty.er v0.2 release notes
[Release Notes Index](README.md)

## Feature updates
- [WIT-77](https://jira.illumina.com/browse/WIT-77) Added binning for Insertions based on insertion size.  Binning is done only for stats generation.  Evaluation is still similar to BreakEnds where there is no size consideration, only the insertion point.
- [WIT-78](https://jira.illumina.com/browse/WIT-78) Added support for reference variant types, details here: [RefCall support in witty.er](https://confluence.illumina.com/display/DAS/RefCall+support+in+witty.er)
