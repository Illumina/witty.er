# Witty.er v0.1 release notes
[Release Notes Index](README.md)

## Feature updates
- Introduced [boundary distance comparison](https://git.illumina.com/DASTE/Ilmn.Das.App.Wittyer#deletions-duplications-and-inversions) to replace reciprocal overlap in [wit.ty](https://git.illumina.com/DASTE/Ilmn.Das.App.Witty/blob/develop/Witty/README.md)
  - _--percentageDistance (-pd)_ and _--basepairDistance (-bpd)_ are introduced to replace _-po_ and _-bpo_
- For intra-chromosome breakend pair, distance between the pair is used in boundary distance comparison, see [breakend comparison](https://git.illumina.com/DASTE/Ilmn.Das.App.Wittyer#insertions-and-breakends)
- Breakend is now binned based on distance between the pair, inter-chromosome breakend always fall into the last bin
- Insertion is now using the same strategy as breakend comparison, basepair distance can be tuned through _-bpd_ (hardcoded to be 200bp in wit.ty)
- _--simpleCounting (--sc)_ and _--crossTypeMatching (--ct)_ options are now merged into one option _--evaluationMode_ with accepted values to be _Default(d)_ , _SimpleCounting(sc)_, _CrossTypeAndSimpleCounting(cts)_
- Base level stats is fully supported for DEL, DUP and CNV
- New and improved set of vcf annotation, see [vcf annotation](https://confluence.illumina.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=201077378#Proposedwit.tyupgrade(akawitty.er)-Detailedvcfspec)
- Support vcf output from WGSv8, TNWv6 and latest DragenCNV


## Known Limitation
- Inserted sequence is not used in Insertion evaluation
- Limited support for multi-allelic entries
  - Multi-alts with different SVTYPEs are annotated as NotAssessed(N) and completely left out from stats
  - For multi-alt CNV gains, witty.er currently only using total CN for evalutation disregard CN number of individual ALT.
